Documentation about threads

THREAD INPUT: array['origin', [ARGS]]

origin: means where the call originates from (ie: SNike.py, SAdidas.py, SWherever.py) so the thread knows what function to launch!

args: all the information args it needs to run that specific function

THREAD OUTPUT: function call in origin (most likely get shoeInfo or something similar)
